<h1>SALUTE</h1>

<p class='ni'>Before advancing a few choice
bits of philosophy, speculation and
what have you, I’m going to introduce
myself. I do this so that you may
promptly divest my theories of any importance
whatever, and let them roll
off your knife smoothly and without effort.
That being done, you can proceed,
if you like, to digest the illustrative anecdote
concerning the little matter of Lieutenant
Percival Enoch O’Reilly, Air
Service, Regular Army, versus Lieutenant
Ralph Kennedy, Air Service, Reserve
Corps.</p>

<p>My name is “Slim” Evans, and I, in
an idle moment in 1917, became a member
of the Army Air Service. I still am,
for the simple reason that I’d have to
work twenty hours a day in civilian life
to make twenty dollars a week. When
I was constructed, the supply of brains,
beauty and good sense was very limited.
However, there was an overplus of noses
and feet, so I turned out six feet five
inches tall; thin enough to chase a fugitive
collar-button down a drain pipe;
and standing in a stooped position on a
pair of feet so large that I couldn’t fall
down if I wanted to.</p>

<p>On the credit side of nigh on to ten
years as a flyer, I can put the fact that
I’ve done practically no work, made
much more money than I’m worth, have
avoided monotony and lived through
moments of great excitement, not to
say thrills. Furthermore, I’ve met diversified
people and events which, thank
God, have kept me from being smug,
complacent or bigoted about anything
whatever. On the debit side of the ledger,
I have only a couple of my own teeth left,
and they do not meet; I have a bad left
shoulder, three elegant and permanent
bumps on my head, and more scars on
me than there are on an ice rink after an
evening’s skating.</p>

<p>With this background, you can attach
as much weight as you want to this statement.
People who’ve lived long enough
and seen enough to comprehend a little
bit of the complexity of human beings
and the motives which spur them to their
daily performances, will never be too
hasty in damning a man to his eternal
roast. On the other hand, they’ll be very
cautious about attaching a pair of wings
and a halo to any living human.</p>

<p>Once I did that. Everything was either
good or bad, including people. There was
no middle ground. As a result of that
asinine viewpoint, there are memories
that rise and smite me when the wind is
in the east. R. E. Morse overtakes me
and makes life a hell for hours at a time, as
I think back to the dumb, cruel things
I’ve done&mdash;and the fact that the same
things have been done to me by others
doesn’t help. Here, a girl I’ve misjudged;
there, a man to whom I’ve said unwarranted
things that I’d give my left hand
to take back, and&mdash;oh, well, you know, I
guess, if you’re out of your mental swaddling
clothes.</p>

<p>Consequently, there may be some importance
to be found in the fact that
my own personally buried skeletons fade
almost into insignificance before the climax
of a situation that I watched on the Rio
Grande, in which I, personally, had no
part. Furthermore, the things I’ve seen&mdash;gone through, some of them,
myself&mdash;in ten years of flying become almost like
unreal, theatrical claptrap, in comparison
with one moment, a mile in the air, that
changed a couple of lives and made
Penoch O’Reilly into a different man.</p>

<p>You gather, I take it, that the affair
made an impression on me.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>My observation of the episode
started one steaming July morning
in McMullen, Texas. Mr. P. Enoch
O’Reilly and myself were members, in
good standing, of the McMullen flight
of the Air Service Border patrol. There
were a dozen flights, consisting of ten or
twelve flyers and observers, scattered
along the Border from Brownsville to
San Diego.</p>

<p>The duty of the blithe young men was
to pilot DeHaviland airplanes up and
down that squirming trouble area, taking
peeks at any little matters such as smuggling,
rustling, or a little plain and fancy
banditing. We aimed to be a sort of
Texas Ranger outfit, riding airplanes instead
of horses and, in some cases, if I
do say it myself, the boys did pretty
well. Well enough to make the roar of
an airplane motor like the voice of doom
to many a frisky outlaw.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock was the hour for the
mail to arrive. I’d just got back from
the western patrol to Laredo and stalked
into the office with my helmet and goggles
still on. It was only a gesture&mdash;I
never get any mail.</p>

<p>Sitting on the edge of a desk in the
operations room, underneath the mailboxes,
was Penoch O’Reilly. He was
holding a letter in his clenched hand, and
his eyes were gazing out of the window
with a look in them which was not good
to see.</p>

<p>Enthroned in the inner office, at their
respective desks, were “Pop” Cravan,
our adjutant, and Captain George Kennard,
our C. O. Pop was round and obese
and bald-headed, with a fiery temper, a
nasty tongue, a soft heart and a keen
mind.</p>

<p>“Hell!” he snorted loudly. “Another
of those reserve officers ordered here for
three months active duty at his own
request! I suppose he’ll crack up three
ships and be more trouble than a case
of hives.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” demanded the stocky,
spike-haired little captain in his raucous
voice.</p>

<p>“Name is Ralph Kennedy, and he’s
a shavetail in the reserve.”</p>

<p>“I know him!” barked Penoch O’Reilly
suddenly. “Here’s a letter from him,
in fact.”</p>

<p>“Enter into the sanctum, sirrah, and
make him known to me,” the C. O. invited
him spaciously.</p>

<p>Penoch strode in with ludicrously long
steps. He was so short that he’d have to
stand on a stepladder to kick a duck in
the stomach.</p>

<p>I drifted in lazily, but my curiosity was
alive. If I wasn’t wrong, the look on
Penoch’s face, as he brooded over that
letter, did not indicate ungovernable enthusiasm
about the arrival of the new man.</p>

<p>“I knew him a little before the war,”
O’Reilly stated in that deep bass voice
of his.</p>

<p>Coming from his little body, that voice
was as surprizing as it would be to get a
brass band effect by blowing on a harmonica.</p>

<p>“He’s not so bad, I guess. Lived an
eventful life, anyhow. Was a sergeant
in the Air Service&mdash;in my outfit a lot of
the time during the war&mdash;and learned
to fly then. Got a commission in the
reserve when the war was over. He’s
a wonderful mechanic, and he can tell
interesting yarns.”</p>

<p>“How well can he fly?” demanded Pop
truculently. “With these bandits raising
hell, and with scarcely enough crates to
get flying time in on, we can’t afford
to let amateurs spread D.H.’s all over the
landscape!”</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” Penoch admitted grudgingly.
“He was an automobile race
driver at one time, a trick motorcycle
artist at another, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Due in this afternoon,” remarked
Pop, examining the orders in his hand.
“Well, I hope he can play bridge.”</p>

<p>Penoch’s set face relaxed into the ghost
of a grin.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty good at most card games,”
he said mysteriously. “Going back to the
tents, Slim?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. All quiet along the river,
Cap.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” Penoch said evenly,
and we marched out.</p>

<p>We were surely a comedy team together;
and we frequently were together,
because Penoch and I had become close
friends as a result of several imbroglios
in which we had engaged. He was just
an inch over five feet, so you can readily
realize that I could have worn the little
squirt for a watch-charm.</p>

<p>“Anything special on your mind?” I
inquired casually.</p>

<p>“Yeah; but I’ll wait until we get to the
tent,” he told me.</p>

<p>We marched on down the line of buildings
that bounded the southern end of the
small sandy airdrome. To the east and
west were big black corrugated iron
hangars, baking in the sun. Northward,
a fence was the rim of the field, and a few
miles farther north was the rim of one
hundred and fifty solid miles of mesquite.</p>

<p>While we are galloping down the line
toward the tents, take a look at one of the
most amazing chunks of humanity I’ve
ever met. Penoch, as I’ve said, was short,
but his torso was round as a barrel, and
his legs straight and thick and sturdy.
His muscles, I’d found, were like steel
cables, and his strength was as much out
of proportion to his size as his voice was.</p>

<p>It was his face, though, that made him
prominent in any company. It was
square and brown; and a pair of the
largest, keenest, brightest blue eyes you
ever saw sparkled forth from it and reflected
an unquenchable joy in life for
its own sake. His hair was red&mdash;not
pink or sandy or auburn, but red. His
eyebrows had been bleached by the sun
to a pale yellow; and below his short,
turned-up nose, a cocky little mustache,
waxed to pin-points, was a similar tint.</p>

<p>His teeth were big and strong and
white, and between them, on occasions,
there rolled a loud, Rabelaisian “Ho-ho-ho!”
that made the welkin ring. Everyone
in hearing distance chuckled with
him. He looked a bit like a burly little
elf&mdash;but when he was serious and worried,
as he was now, wrinkles leaped into being,
and those eyes got hard as diamonds.
Then age and experience and hard competence
were written for all the world to
read.</p>

<p>He is, was, and will be until he dies,
one of the most famous characters in the
Army. Some of the highlights of his
Army career include being stranded in
a West Virginia town, where the miners,
on strike, were hostile; declaring martial
law without authority and running the
town for thirteen days, until he could
get out; being captured in the Philippines
by hostile Moros, given up for lost, and
finally returning, safe and sound, an
honorary chieftain of the tribe; and numberless
other accomplishments of renown.
He had been court-martialed a hundred
times, due to his peculiar sense of humor,
and had always been acquitted, because a
board of officers who’ve laughed steadily
for hours at the testimony can’t get
tough.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he usually hauled his
friends into any trouble which he found
for himself. I myself had been court-martialed,
along with him and Charley De
Shields, just a month before. All due
to his funny ideas. It gives a little sidelight
on a man who is tough to describe,
so I’ll tell it.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>The three of us were in San Antonio
on a week-end leave, and at
one in the morning we were a bit tight,
so to speak. Penoch called up a couple
of girls for the purpose of throwing a roadhouse
dance party. Being respectable
young ladies and in bed, they haughtily
bawled him out for calling at such an
hour. That made Penoch decide upon
vengeance. Charley De Shields is just
as nutty as Penoch, and I’m no paragon
of dignity.</p>

<p>It was Penoch’s idea, though. The
apartment house was a small one, in a
quiet section of town, and it boasted a
small, cozily furnished lobby. We proceeded
to divest that lobby of all its
furniture. When we finished, we had
chairs on top of Charley’s sedan, a davenport
on the hood, and everything from
potted palms to rugs and bric-a-brac
inside the car. The lobby was furnished
with a telephone, when we left.</p>

<p>Out at Donovan Field we rang the
doorbells of our friends, presenting each
one with a tasty bit of house-furnishing,
as a token of esteem. At five in the morning
we retired, to be awakened at two in
the afternoon by the news that the owner
of the apartment house was after our
scalps, and that returning the furniture
might knock off a couple of years from
our sentences.</p>

<p>We’d forgotten just where we’d left
the stuff. However, we secured a big
truck and went from house to house,
collecting. At dark we set forth for
town, between cheering lines of unregenerate
flyers. Penoch was on the front
seat, clasping a large and ornate vase
lovingly, to keep it from breaking.
Artificial flowers were in his other hand.
Charley tended three standing lamps
carefully in the body of the truck and I,
at the rear end, blushingly chaperoned
a frail chair of the vintage of Louis
Quinze, a plant in a glass container, and
three spittoons.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Perhaps I shouldn’t have mentioned
it; but <i>that</i> was Penoch. He radiated
more energy than his weight in radium;
he could fight like three wildcats rolled
into one, and he laughed at, and with,
life twenty-four hours a day&mdash;usually.</p>

<p>Which made his present preoccupation
all the more impressive. We said not a
word, until we were in my little two-by-four
tent.</p>

<p>“Shoot,” I commanded, and he set
himself for that purpose.</p>

<p>Whenever he had anything of importance
to say, he always planted himself
with his legs wide apart, as if setting himself
against an onslaught, and he talked
with his body motionless, except for a
stabbing, emphatic finger.</p>

<p>“It’s about this bird Ralph Kennedy,”
he stated, “and I need advice.”</p>

<p>This admission from the self-sufficient
Penoch was remarkable in itself. It became
even more so as I took a good look
at his face. It was hard and set, pugnacious
jaw outthrust, and his eyes were
a curious mixture of cold savagery and
dazed bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I guess you didn’t exactly shoot your
wad to Kennard, then,” I said as casually
as I could.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I never have to any one,
except you; and that was because I had
to. I’m afraid I’ve got to now!”</p>

<p>He just clipped those last words off,
with snaps of his teeth.</p>

<p>“You know considerable about me,”
he went on, seeming to plant himself more
solidly, as his eyes met mine squarely.</p>

<p>“Not so damn’ much,” I came back.
“You were in France, of course, and left
the army to join the Kosciusko squadron
in Poland. Then you were an instructor
in the Mexican Air Service, and finally
got back into the Army and went to the
Philippines for two years. Now here you
are. That’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know I’ve got into trouble
in my life,” he stated. “Anyhow, Slim,
I’m up against it now. To make a long
story short, I come of a wonderful family,
I suppose, but I ran away from home, and
between the years of fifteen and twenty
went through a sort of hell, I guess.
That’s when I met this bird Kennedy.
He picked me up when I was a starving
hobo, and he proceeded to use me for his
own purpose. I was valuable to him in a
lot of ways. He’s a sort of crooked adventurer&mdash;or
was. But I’ll swear I was
innocent as a baby at the time!”</p>

<p>“The soup begins to thicken,” I said
slowly. “Well, what happened? What
was his line?”</p>

<p>“The first thing he had me do was go
around and place a bunch of punch-boards
in saloons in Buffalo,” Penoch
said in that fog-horn voice of his. “There
were two hundred dollars’ worth of
punches on each board, and the saloon-keeper
was to put up a regulation number
of cash prizes&mdash;so many twenty-dollar
bills, so many tens, and so on, totaling
two hundred bucks. When the board
was punched out, I was to come around
and collect ten dollars for the use of it.
We furnished a list of prize-winning numbers,
a board to exhibit the prizes on and
the punchboard itself.”</p>

<p>“That seems all right,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Sure.” For a second his face lightened,
and he was the sparkling, zestful
boy again. “But Ralph went around to
every saloon and punched out all the
prize-winning numbers! Ho-ho-ho!”</p>

<p>I had scarcely started laughing, when
his face suddenly turned bleak and cold
again, and my laugh, somehow, died in
my throat.</p>

<p>“I realized later that I’d been an accomplice
in a good many things outside
of the law&mdash;getting him acquainted with
people he could fleece, and all that sort of
thing. Finally, he worked the old mine salting
racket; but, Slim, he worked it on
me! I thought the thing was a cinch, and
I persuaded two well-off men I’d got to
know to invest a lot of money in it. It was
a plain swindle&mdash;me innocent, and those
men are looking for me yet, I guess.
Slim, he can blast me right out of the
Army and&mdash;well, jail’s a cinch, I think.”</p>

<p>I could understand all the implications
in his words. My own life hasn’t been
so easy. And when a man hits the open
road, to lick the world from a standing
start, and is thrown with the scum of that
same world through necessity, often with
starvation stalking at his side, there are
bound to be episodes which the smug people
of this world, who’ve never missed
a meal or had a fight, think damn one to
eternity. There are ghosts in the closet
of every wanderer that ever lived.</p>

<p>“You think he’s out to do you dirt,”
I said finally.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. As a matter of fact,
Slim, I think he likes me a lot. But he’s
for Number One all the time. As cold
and unmoral a snake of a man as ever
breathed. He’d throw his family, if he
had one, to the lions to save himself.
And from the time he caught up with me,
during the war, to the time I got out, he
haunted me. He got himself made a
sergeant assigned to my outfit. He borrowed
my money, made me introduce him
to people I didn’t want to know him,
because I distrusted him; he took it for
granted that he could have special privileges.
And now that he’s found me again,
he aims to be a parasite for the rest of his
life. I know it!”</p>

<p>“The short and ugly word,” I observed
casually, “is blackmail. A bullet is a
merciful death for one of that stripe.”</p>

<p>Penoch’s hand stabbed out at me.</p>

<p>“I know it. And yet the man is likable
in a lot of ways, as you’ll see. Maybe he
thinks I owe him plenty. In a lot of ways
he defers to me, admires me and likes
me. But, as I say, when he gets in any
kind of trouble, or wants anything for
himself, there isn’t a thing in the world
as important as himself. He’d loan me
money, if he had it, and he’d sell me into
jail for five thousand dollars, if he was
broke. The only reason in this world that
he’s coming here is to live off of me. He
must be broke, or a fugitive, or something.
He’ll draw his pay, borrow mine, if he
needs it, and never pay it back. He’ll
take it for granted that I’ll do everything
in the world for him. If I refuse, he’ll
use the club he has over me without
mercy.”</p>

<p>“And he’s a reserve officer,” I ruminated
aloud. “Listen, Penoch. You’ve
got the goods on him. You can plaster
him behind the bars. Why not call his
hand and take your chances? You were
young, innocent&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It would kill the folks,” O’Reilly said
steadily, “and the Army and flying right
now means a hell of a lot to me. It’s
not so easy, Slim.”</p>

<p>Which it wasn’t, of course.</p>

<p>“Aside from the money angle, Penoch&mdash;and
say, that needn’t be so bad, at that!
If that bozo starts to blackmail you out of
your dough, there’s no reason why ‘Tex’
MacDowell, ‘Sleepy’ Spears and myself
each can’t fix up a bit of a game and get
it back from him by fair means or foul.
We’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Won’t do, Slim,” he told me. “That
is, it might, if it was worked cagily. But
if he thought for a minute that I’d given
him away he’d plaster me to a fare-you-well.
And that isn’t the worst of it&mdash;the
money, I mean. He’s funny. He’s got a
hell of a lot of false pride, or maybe he
really thinks he’s fit to enter any home in
the country. He’d just move right in
with me, and he’d be so sore he’d never
let up on me, if he so much as suspected
that I was stalling him off from meeting
any of my friends. And there I am!
In a position of having to introduce a
man I’m not sure won’t cheat at cards,
make love to a man’s wife, or anything
else. And if I don’t, it’s out of the Army
in disgrace, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s a tough spot,” I said unnecessarily,
and he stared morosely at me as
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s no Paradise.”</p>

<p>Then his face seemed to harden. It was
all in his eyes, and they were bleak and
cold.</p>

<p>“But that devil had better not get
gay. If worst comes to worst, I’ll kick
him out of the Army, resign myself, and
hit the road.”</p>

<p>He sort of grated that out, and I cut
in hastily:</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, he’d better not slip
on the cards or the rest of it, or I’ll personally
get him. He doesn’t strike me as
any credit to the Army.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be too smart for that&mdash;around
the field, anyway. I suppose I’m a coward;
but I’ll be miserable while he’s here.
I’m hoping he won’t be tempted to do his
stuff. Honest, Slim, what do you think?
That I’ll be a damn’ heel to introduce him
around? That I ought to give him away
to start?”</p>

<p>“No,” I told him, after no thought
whatever. “Maybe he’s reformed. Anybody
you introduce him to will be free,
white, twenty-one and able to look out
for himself. And I see no reason for
you to open up a knife, sharpen it and
stick it in your own gizzard before it’s
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t take long to make it
necessary. He’ll hang around my neck
just once too often.”</p>

<p>With that I left him for the bath-house,
there to get washed, polished and highly
perfumed. During the rest of the day
no loud “ho-ho-ho!” rang out over the
field. If I had any tendency to forget
the situation, Penoch’s set face was a
constant reminder. Consequently, you
won’t find it hard to believe that I accepted
Penoch’s invitation to become a
member of the welcoming committee.
I accepted agilely, as a matter of fact,
and the witching hour of three forty-five
found us tooling his dilapidated old
roadster down the thronged main street
of McMullen, as quietly as a flock of
tanks.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>McMullen is one of those new,
shiny, progressive little Texas
cities, where transportation includes cow-ponies
and Rolls Royces. It is a mixture
of the old and the new. A completely
equipped, honest-to-God old cowboy will
tie up his horse in front of a store that
sells Parisian gowns.</p>

<p>The depot, as always, held a considerable
crowd to greet the one daily train
from San Antone. No sooner had Penoch
guided his panting monster into parking
space, and its wheezes and moans died,
than a shiny eight-cylinder speedster
appeared in the next stall. A feminine
voice was yelling:</p>

<p>“Hello, flyers! Who’s arriving?”</p>

<p>“Reserve officer; friend of mine,”
Penoch was forced to say. “How’s my
secret sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” returned Miss Shirley Curran
airily, hopping out of her car and into
ours. “Well, I suppose I might as well
look him over.”</p>

<p>She was nineteen&mdash;one of these slightly
dizzy, somewhat confusing flappers that
senile old men of thirty-odd like myself
had a hard time getting used to a few
years back. She was slim and thin-faced
and good-looking, with boyishly
bobbed blond hair, snapping blue eyes,
and agile tongue. She was tireless&mdash;a
slim streak of flame, who could dance all
night, ride all day, smoke seven packages
of cigarets, and look as fresh as a daisy.</p>

<p>Her dad was a great old Texan, who’d
played a lot of poker, drunk a lot of
liquor and had been a great ladies’ man in
his time. She was the apple of his eye&mdash;and
a good apple, too. She was a pal to
many of the flyers; although, for real
playmates, she preferred less mature
samples of the male sex&mdash;college boys and
that sort, who could fling a mean hoof.</p>

<p>She chatted along until the train rattled
in and Penoch left the car.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“Just moody, I guess; he gets that
way.”</p>

<p>“He does not. He’s about as moody as
our cow.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ask him, then,” I told her.</p>

<p>As if sensing my own curiosity, she
fell silent, and both of us searched the
crowd eagerly. We weren’t more than
thirty feet from the steps of the single
battered Pullman, so I could note every
line in the face of the man who shook
hands so enthusiastically with doughty
little Penoch.</p>

<p>That greeting surprized me. Kennedy’s
eyes were shining; his face held a
genial and infectious grin, and I’ll swear
that it was plain as the nose on my face
that he liked Penoch a lot. And Penoch,
too, seemed to melt. I guess the memories
of a thousand times, good and bad, creates
a bond, even between enemies,
when they meet after a long separation.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he good-looking!” exclaimed
Shirley with zest. “That’s the cutest
mustache!”</p>

<p>And she was right. He was of medium
height, dressed in blue serge and a jaunty
straw hat. He removed the hat, as they
approached the car, talking eagerly. His
hair was black as night, wiry and wavy.
His eyes were gray or blue, his nose long
and straight; the carefully tailored mustache
softened a thin mouth. His shoulders
were broad, and his body looked as
hard as rock.</p>

<p>As they came closer, I had a funny
feeling. He fairly radiated personality;
but, somehow, in his slightly small,
slightly too close together eyes, I thought
I could see meanness. Probably it was
because of what Penoch had said, but
I seemed to see through a shallow layer
of geniality and kindness into a man
wherein there was neither moral sense
nor unselfishness. Just something as cold
and impersonal and impregnable as a rock.</p>

<p>As he approached us, his eyes, which I
could now distinguish as green, rested
continuously on Shirley. If ever I saw
bold admiration, I saw it then. There was
something coldly appraising in his stare,
and an uncanny hypnotic effect. I’ll
swear I had a job pulling my own optics
off his.</p>

<p>I made one or two revisions regarding
his personal appearance, too. In the
first place, his hair was shot with gray;
in the second place, his chin seemed a bit
weak; in the third place, he was an attractive
man, despite everything.</p>

<p>When Penoch introduced Shirley and
me, he bowed low&mdash;a bit too low&mdash;and
said:</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you both. So the
boy’s bought himself a buggy, has he?
Some car, ‘Peewee,’ some car!”</p>

<p>He looked it over with a wide grin.</p>

<p>“It didn’t go through the war with you,
did it?” he inquired, and he chuckled.
It was as merry a chuckle as I’ve ever
heard, too.</p>

<p>Every second or two his eyes would
flicker to Shirley’s, and never did I see
her own gaze drop. When she got into
her own car, he handed her in with a
flourish, then held her hand a little too
long, as he stared into her eyes.</p>

<p>“If you&mdash;if you aren’t all cluttered up
with the well known husband or something,
I hope I see more of you, pretty
lady,” he said airily.</p>

<p>Shirley didn’t blush so easily, but the
man had her on the run. Despite his
careful dress and too careful manners,
he gave a subtle impression that he was
a rough and ready guy at bottom; but
one who had a lot of sheer animal power,
without much leavening of civilized feeling.
And when he stared at you with
those green eyes, you forgot, momentarily,
that something that I’ve tried to describe;
the cold, diamond-hard core within him,
I mean, and that the geniality of him was
a reflection from the surface.</p>

<p>“Nothing like starting to get the old
hooks in right at the start,” he grinned as
he got in with us and waved farewell to
Shirley. “By the way, Peewee, how’s
the old heart been doing lately? Any
more of the old dents in it?”</p>

<p>“Nary one,” responded little Penoch.
“Well, how’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“Neither here nor there. Not so good
lately. Right now, if a house and lot
could be bought for a nickel, I couldn’t
buy a doorknob; so I decided to let Uncle
Samuel take care of me for a while.
Heh-heh-heh!”</p>

<p>When he chuckled like that, you
thought of him as a jovial, humorous
scoundrel. And before that twenty
minute ride was over, he’d told Penoch
a couple of yarns about himself, and had
O’Reilly in hysterics and me laughing
like the devil. I noted, likewise, that he
slipped into the “I seen” and “I done”
manner of speech. Being grammatical
was foreign to him, as was his bowing
to a woman. All surface polish, poorly
done.</p>

<p>He moved into the flight with a careless
confidence that was sublime. At the dinner
table, under Penoch’s prodding, he
talked and talked with agility and abandon.
He’d been everywhere and done
everything and, as far as I could tell,
he’d been a drunkard and a gambler and
a Lothario through it all. Whatever
business he had afoot rarely interfered
with his wassail and debauch.</p>

<p>He could tell a story so vividly, and
with such a sense of humor, that one forgot
the bad taste it left in the mouth and
just capitulated to the bizarre humor of
it. Burglars, gangsters, army officers
and persons of high degree came casually
into his conversation with bewildering
effect. To my dying day I’ll never forget
his story of a one week’s job as chauffeur to
a certain internationally famous family.
Carnival life, race driving, hot political
campaigns, the low-down on the underworld
of three big cities. Before the
evening was over all these things had been
touched on; Kennedy was jovially drunk,
and the flight had sat at his feet and listened
with unflagging interest. Never
once did he slip and make himself an
actor in an illegal episode; he was the
looker-on, although admitting to friendship
with many a criminal.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Early the next morning I set off on
the western patrol. To make a long
story short, I ran into some bandits, held
them awhile with my machine-guns, but
finally lost them, due to a forced landing
that resulted in my absence from McMullen
for three days. Finally, with my
ship repaired, I flew it back to the
airdrome just at dusk. As I sat down to a
late and lonely dinner, Penoch came in
with that dignified, long-striding gait.</p>

<p>“How’s your friend Kennedy?” I
asked him promptly.</p>

<p>“Borrowed two hundred bucks for uniforms
and such,” he boomed crisply, and
sat himself down.</p>

<p>I took one look at him; and that was
enough.</p>

<p>“You might as well shoot the works.
What’s he been up to?” I inquired.
“First, how do the boys like him?”</p>

<p>“They get a great kick out of him.
They know he’s not their equal by birth
or breeding or anything like that. It’s
a sort of patronizing friendship, if you
get what I mean. That’s what he gets
from most people, and what he resents
most when, if and as he gets hep to it.”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, why the woebegone look in
your port eye and the stricken stare in
the other?” I asked spaciously.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to seem too serious about
it. He got to his feet and put one foot
on a chair.</p>

<p>“Shirley’s fallen right into his trap,” he
barked. “He’s got her hooked tighter
than Grant had Richmond; and he’s got
to lay off!”</p>

<p>“Peewee! Where’s the boy?”</p>

<p>Penoch’s eyes darted to mine, and his
face froze.</p>

<p>“Stick around, and you’ll see some
fun,” he barked raucously, and then his
voice reverberated thunderously from
the rafters.</p>

<p>“In the dining hall! Come in!”</p>

<p>In came Kennedy, resplendent in a
uniform as new as the label on a bottle of
bootleg whisky. He was washed, polished
and highly perfumed, and he looked
well.</p>

<p>“’Lo, Slim! Welcome home! Say,
Peewee, can you slip me twenty? I’m
as flat as near-beer. Until pay-day?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. I’m broke myself.”</p>

<p>Penoch was on his feet, legs wide
apart, planted solidly. His barrel-like,
little body seemed to stretch, until his
clothes were drawn tightly over it, and
his mustache was bristling fiercely. His
eyes were bright and cold.</p>

<p>“I’m a stranger, almost; how about
borrowing it for me?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, kid? Ain’t sore,
are you?”</p>

<p>Kennedy seemed really hurt and surprized.
As a matter of fact, it was as
plain to me as anything could be that
Kennedy thought as much of Penoch as
he did of any living human. He never
missed a chance to slide in a statement
that Penoch was a great little guy; and
the number of tales he recounted that
first evening, to prove what a fighter,
thinker and all-round champion Penoch
was, were numberless.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. But I’ve got something
to say to you, Ralph, and now’s the time.
First off, Slim, here, and Slim alone,
knows the works. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Who told him?”</p>

<p>Kennedy’s face was a mask, now, and
the eyes of a snake looked into mine,
then shifted to Penoch.</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Give yourself the best of it?”</p>

<p>There was venom dripping from his
tongue when he said that. He backed
away slightly, as if fearful of a physical
assault.</p>

<p>“What a fine pal you are!” he spat.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, you listen. You
lay off Shirley, Ralph, or I’ll have your
history published in the paper! I’ve
hinted at it before. Now I tell you!”</p>

<p>Penoch’s were blazing into Kennedy’s,
and his right fist was stabbing the air.
He was set for the battle, be the result
what it might.</p>

<p>“Just where do you think you’d end
up in that case? And where do you come
in to criticize anybody else?” sneered
Kennedy.</p>

<p>His eyes seemed rat-like then, somehow,
as if they were flickering about for
an opening for escape.</p>

<p>“For the sake of argument, we’ll say
nowhere!” Penoch fairly roared. “I’ve
paid your bills and hauled you around,
and introduced a man I wasn’t sure
wouldn’t steal family jewelry, to plenty of
people. So far, I haven’t had anything
but worry over it. But this is different.”</p>

<p>“So you’re pulling the big blackjack,
are you? Rough-stuff, huh? Well, I’m
pretty good at that myself, Peewee. So
you mind your own damn’ business&mdash;or
else&mdash;”</p>

<p>Kennedy’s eyes were flat and green and
cold, his lips drawn back in the suspicion
of a smile, and he looked as close to
cruelty incarnate as I care to gaze upon.
And hard&mdash;gosh!</p>

<p>“I’ll do no such thing. And you get
just exactly three days to wind up your
little affair with Shirley, or I start talking.
You can start at the same time, and
be damned to you! But we’ll both go
down together, big boy. You’ll go down
farthest. My resignation’ll be in before
I start shooting off my mouth; I
figure on that.”</p>

<p>For a long ten seconds Kennedy’s unwinking
eyes bored into blazing Penoch’s.
The indomitable little flyer, as if carved
out of granite, stood there and waited.
Kennedy threw his cap on the table. His
voice softened, and in a wheedling tone he
said:</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Penoch? Good
lord, boy, don’t go off half-cocked. I
ain’t done nothin’ to Shirley or her old
man.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, maybe! Why she ever fell
for you, I don’t know; but she has. And
if you’ve got any intentions at all, they’re
rotten, and I know it. You couldn’t
marry her if you wanted to, and if you
could and did, she’d break her heart in
six months. You’re a natural born
crook and you know it. You’re a great
guy in some ways; but there isn’t one
gram of honesty in your whole body.
You’ll end up broke or in jail, as sure as
there’s a jail left. You never gave a woman
in love with you a square break in
your life, or hesitated at getting everything
you could out of any man or woman
who got in your power.</p>

<p>“And if you think I’m going to be responsible
for getting a kid like Shirley
into any mess with you, you’re crazy!
If you get her she’ll know what she’s
getting, and I don’t mean maybe. You’re
no more eligible to wear that uniform or
to mix socially with Shirley than I am to
be the Grand Gazabo of Guam. Now, by
God, you make up your mind. You’re
going to do one decent thing in your life,
and you’re going to do it within three
days, by wiping Shirley off the slate and
staying where you belong. If you don’t,
you know what I’ll do. That goes just
exactly as it lays!”</p>

<p>Penoch had been talking in low, deep
tones, but every word was like a muffled
bullet. When he had finished, a dangerous
human being was crouched, figuratively
speaking, with his back to the wall.
I put in my horn then, having been stricken
with an idea.</p>

<p>“Penoch’s right, big boy,” I told him.
“As a matter of fact, why the hesitation?
Shirley means nothing to you except a
time-passer&mdash;a kid like that.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? How do you know so
much?” he snarled.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed to Penoch’s.</p>

<p>“Gone back on me, have you? All
right, you lousy little double-crosser.
Watch yourself, and plenty! I’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll what?”</p>

<p>O’Reilly had covered the space between
them in one bound, like a bounced
ball. Suddenly sheer hatred burned from
two pairs of eyes. Kennedy licked his
lips, and his smile was mirthless and his
eyes indescribable.</p>

<p>“I said to watch yourself,” he said
softly. “I don’t like people that talk too
much.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” I interrupted slowly, “that
it may be time for me to do some talking.”</p>

<p>“Talk all you want to; but you stand
the gaff, and don’t forget that, Peewee!”</p>

<p>The look he threw over his shoulder, as
he walked out, left no doubt about what
he meant. O’Reilly’s body relaxed slightly,
but his face remained set and strained.</p>

<p>“I’ve always thought,” he said slowly,
“that there weren’t many bozos in the
world I’d hate to have as an enemy as
much as I would Ralph. And now the
wad is shot, Slim. I guess I’m in for it.
But what the hell? The fact that I’ve
talked to you will be the last straw, as far
as he’s concerned. Shirley or no Shirley,
he’s doing a lot of low and lofty thinking
right now. And he’ll have a way figured
to get even with me, if it takes a year,
without hurting himself. Three days
from now should be interesting, what?
Ho-ho-ho! The skeletons’ll be out doing
a song and dance for all McMullen to
watch, eh?”</p>

<p>Now that the die was cast, Penoch was
himself again, daring the world to do its
worst. Indomitable, hard-boiled, soft-hearted,
he flung his loud, raucous laughter
in Kennedy’s face, so to speak, challenging
him and the universe in general
to get him down.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you have talked quietly
to Shirley,” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Tried to,” he boomed absently. “She
wouldn’t even listen. She’s nuts, I tell
you, and the old man likes him. He’s
given them a long song and dance about
his automobile business in Los Angeles,
and all that stuff. If I went to the old
man and told him, there’d be hell to pay;
the truth would come out that I had
peached on him, and then my neck would
be chopped neatly. Whichever way it’s
done, there’ll be the same result when I
expose him. I’m sunk myself.”</p>

<p>“Right now,” I ruminated, “he may
not be satisfied with just smearing your
reputation and having you tried for that
mine salting business, at that. Struck
me he’d love to throttle you.”</p>

<p>“I guess he would,” Penoch said calmly.
“He served five years for manslaughter
in Virginia once.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>I went to bed early. I hadn’t had
much sleep for three days, so at ten
o’clock in the morning I was still pounding
my ear commodiously. I was awakened
by long, lean, drawling Tex
MacDowell.</p>

<p>“Take a peek at the paper and then
arise and shine,” he told me. “We start
for the Gulf of Mexico in exactly one
hour.”</p>

<p>One peer at the headlines, that took up
half the front page, awakened me as
thoroughly as a pail of ice water would
have.</p>

<p>“Laguna In Ruins!” the paper
screamed in letters big enough to put on a
signboard.</p>

<p>Within a moment I had the details.
One of those tidal waves, estimated as at
least a hundred feet high and two miles
in width, had swept in from the Gulf.
Doubtless the result of a volcanic eruption
on the sea floor. According to the
meager reports available, every house,
structure and living thing existing in the
portion of Laguna, within a half mile of
the beach, had been doomed by that vast
crush of water. The remainder of the
town, back farther from the beach, had
been inundated; but houses were standing,
and many of the people had escaped
alive. The low country&mdash;marshy ground,
a lot of it, anyway&mdash;was under three feet
of water, and Laguna, as well as small
settlements along the beach, which had
likewise been demolished, was a marooned
and ruined little city. Telegraph lines
down, railroads washed out, telephones
useless, and at least one thousand people
dead or washed out to sea.</p>

<p>“We go over to patrol the Gulf for
survivors,” Tex said tersely. “Donovan
Field ships will ferry food and water and
medical supplies down. We leave in an
hour. Get a move on!”</p>

<p>All I could think of, as I made passes at
my whiskers and leaped into my clothes
and gulped some food was this&mdash;how
must it feel to look up and see millions
of tons of water about to fall on you? A
ten foot wave in a storm makes me feel
like an ant bucking a steam roller.</p>

<p>Four men were to be left at the field for
patrol. Six ships were warming up, as I
ran out on the field. The roar of the half-dozen
four hundred and fifty horsepower
Libertys fairly shook the earth, and their
propellers send clouds of dust swirling
upward. As I approached the line, a
car tore into the airdrome. There was
Shirley, her hair blowing in the wind, as
she streaked down the road toward the
ships.</p>

<p>As I got closer, I saw her fling herself
out of the roadster and make a beeline
for none other than Kennedy. Penoch
O’Reilly was standing near by, his face
a study.</p>

<p>“Kennedy going down?” I asked him,
noting meanwhile that Shirley and Kennedy
were holding hands.</p>

<p>“Begged to,” boomed O’Reilly. “He’s
got guts, all right, and a craving for
excitement.”</p>

<p>“How’s he acting&mdash;toward you, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t speak. Hardly speaks to
anybody. I think he’s afraid some of the
rest are wise to him.”</p>

<p>Just then I saw Shirley lean forward,
as if to kiss him good-by. He looked
around almost furtively and held her off.
Mr. Ralph Kennedy, for the moment, was
very unsure of his ground. As Penoch
and I passed him on our way to our ships,
his eyes rested on us for just a moment.
They were passionless, but when his face
was serious the meanness in it seemed to
be intensified. Funny what an effect
eyes too close together can give. Add
that mouth&mdash;and my imagination&mdash;and
perhaps you can see what I mean. Somehow,
I shivered.</p>

<p>A moment later I was in my ship, giving
her the last look-over, as she strained
against the wheel-blocks. Oil pressure,
air pressure, rotations per minute, battery-charging
rate, temperature&mdash;all were
O. K. Captain Kennard was already
swinging out on the field; I being Number
Two followed him, and the others
took up the parade in their proper positions.
One by one we took off, circling
the field for altitude in single file. At a
thousand feet the C. O. zoomed, and I
slid in, twenty-five feet behind him,
twenty-five feet to one side, and ten feet
higher than he. Tex MacDowell came
in on the left, and the others followed,
until a V of ships, three on one side and
four on the other, turned eastward and
thundered their way toward the Gulf.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Formation is tricky stuff. You
hold your position by throttle-handling
alone. There are no brakes on airplanes,
as you may have heard. It’s no
time to commence mooning upon the
whichness of the what, nor the why of the
how. You ’tend to your knitting, if you
don’t want a collision, and I ’tended to
mine plenty. Subsconsciously I noted
that Kennedy, at the rear of the left side,
was holding his position well. Pretty
fair flyer, he was. Penoch was behind
me.</p>

<p>In an hour we were on the outskirts of
the flood district. Ten minutes later I
was stealing looks at the ground. We
seemed to be flying over a shallow lake,
from which houses and barns and cattle
protruded. About two feet of water, I
should say, covered the ground, and dozens
of people were gathered on each
knoll. Houses were down here and there,
but not until we reached the outskirts
of Laguna itself, did the real devastation
become apparent.</p>

<p>As we circled that town, it seemed as if
I couldn’t move. It looked like some
gigantic canvas, whereon some artist had
painted his idea of a shambles. The back
part of the town still had buildings; the
streets, clogged with small débris and
overturned automobiles, was the sole
evidence, save for broken chimneys, of
the water. The beach section was nothing
but one gigantic rubbish pile. Ten-story
buildings had toppled and fallen
in ruins, and for a space of at least a
square mile, it seemed, there was not even
a lane through the wreckage. Try to
picture a heap of rubbish, so gigantic that
a hundred automobiles, or more, flung
upon it looked like so many flies. Dozens
of boats, ranging from oil-tankers to
canoes, had been flung hundreds of feet
inland, like so many children’s toys flung
on a dump.</p>

<p>The Gulf itself held a scum of débris
of all kinds, and its shore, as far as we
could see, was a rim of ruins.</p>

<p>I had not seen a single spot where a
landing was possible. Kennard had wigwagged
his ship, and one by one we fell
into single file. Down below, thousands
of people&mdash;the survivors&mdash;had their heads
turned upward. Down in the ruins I
could see bodies, now, and out in the bay
unnumbered corpses were floating.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kennard started down, and
then I saw what had been done. There
had been other disasters and floods in
Texas, when the airplanes had saved
lives. Laguna had prepared. A force
of hundreds of men was just finishing
the job of clearing a hundred-foot runway
down the hard-packed beach on
the outskirts of the town; and it was there,
one by one, that we landed, to face haggard,
hollow-eyed men, steeped in
tragedy.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Much happened during our days at
Laguna; but that has nothing to
do with Penoch O’Reilly and Ralph
Kennedy. Anyway, twenty minutes
later we were all back in the air, carrying
packages of food and water, put up to
float. Each of us had a sector assigned.
We went roaring out over the open Gulf,
spotting survivors who were floating on
improvised rafts or clinging to planks.
Kennard’s ship, with Jack Beaman at
the radio key, was flashing information to
San Antonio. Soon the Donovan ships
would be coming in, carrying supplies.</p>

<p>As we got out over the water, I turned
to look at George Hickman, pointing
downward. He’s big and blond and
nerveless; but his face was strained, and
there was the closest thing to fear, that
I’ve ever seen in his eyes.</p>

<p>As for me, I was one jump ahead of a
fit. Down below, flashing along between
carcasses of human beings and animals,
were what seemed like untold hundreds of
fins, cutting the water and feeding on their
prey. Six times we swooped low to drop
food and water to those poor wretches
down below us. We could almost look
into sharks’ eyes, and time after time the
flash of a white belly announced another
mouthful.</p>

<p>Remember this, too. If we came down
in the water, we could float two hours.
There was not a single serviceable boat
to rescue a soul.</p>

<p>I flew six solid hours that day, as did
every one of the others. It was just before
the last patrol, and getting dusk,
when I ran into Kennedy for the first
time. Our landings hadn’t synchronized
before.</p>

<p>“God!” I heard him mumble in an unutterably
tired voice. “This’ll drive me
nuts! I can’t even swim, if I come down.”</p>

<p>“No difference, my boy,” Jimmy Jennings
told him with an attempt at jauntiness.
“None of us could swim over a
mile. Who thinks he could make five
hundred feet through that forest of fins?”</p>

<p>And he was right. It seemed as if
every shark in the Atlantic ocean had
come to the picnic. But there were still
unexplored sections, little towns along
the shore which needed help, and on we
went. Twenty Donovan ships were
ferrying supplies; one came in almost
every ten minutes. God knows we were
willing to fly until we dropped. Those
poor devils down in the water will haunt
me to my dying day, I guess.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>The sun was setting, when I turned
around from a spot ten miles out in
the Gulf, my last package dropped and
my patrol over. My twelve-cylinder
Liberty had never missed a lick, and I
remembered saying over and over to the
rhythm of the motors:</p>

<p>“If you’ll only keep it up&mdash;if you’ll
only keep it up&mdash;”</p>

<p>My ears were ringing from a day’s
bombardment; my face was so sun-burnt
with sun and wind that it was sore
as a boil, and I was more tired than I’ve
ever been in my life. Two other D.H.’s,
one a mile to my right and the other on
beyond, were coming home across the
vile, befouled water.</p>

<p>I was two thousand feet high, and land
was six or seven miles ahead, when Hickman
grabbed me with a grip like a vise.
My heart did a backflip, and I turned as
if I’d been shot. He was pointing to the
right. In a second I had swung my ship
and was flying wide-open toward that
middle D.H.</p>

<p>It was coming down in a shallow dive.
The propeller was turning as slowly as a
water-wheel. One look was enough to
tell me that the motor was dead, and that
only the air-stream was moving the stick.</p>

<p>Two of the boys were going to the
sharks.</p>

<p>I was diving now, motor full on. I
don’t know why. I guess I had some wild
idea that I could help them out. The
other ship was heading for the falling
D.H., too. We ranged alongside it almost
together. The pilot in the crippled
plane was Ralph Kennedy. The man in
the third ship was Penoch O’Reilly.</p>

<p>Everyone was flying alone, except me,
for two reasons. One was to leave more
room for supplies to drop; the other was
to conserve manpower as much as possible.
I had George along to work the
radio. We’d reconnoitered some outlying
towns on the trip.</p>

<p>It seemed a year before the ship hit,
and I was thinking at top speed, searching
for some possible method of saving
Kennedy. He could float for two hours;
then he’d be sunk&mdash;</p>

<p>Just before the ship hit the water I let
out a wild yell, which I myself couldn’t
hear. Right ahead of Kennedy was a
huge, partially submerged thing floating.
It looked like a bunch of logs tied together.
I guess he never saw it.</p>

<p>The ship crashed into it with its undercarriage.
Just what happened I don’t
know, because the water rose in a geyser,
and I couldn’t see for a moment. But
what I saw, when the water subsided, was
plenty.</p>

<p>It seemed that the ship had been
crumpled completely. It had turned
on its back. Kennedy was invisible.
The fuselage had broken in half, the
wings crumpled back, and the motor,
of course, was under water. That little
heap of wreckage would become water-soaked
in a few minutes. It would sink
in a quarter of an hour, instead of in
two hours.</p>

<p>I guess I was shaking a little. I remember
Penoch, circling and circling.
Kennedy had not come to the surface.</p>

<p>“Knocked out and drowning&mdash;maybe
a mercy,” I was thinking, and four fins,
circling, sent cold chills up and down my
back.</p>

<p>Then he came to the surface. He
struggled weakly to climb up out of the
water, but it took him a full two minutes.
Even then he was partly submerged.
Suddenly the sight of those fins set me
crazy, I guess.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a chance to drown, at
least!” I fairly shouted at them; and the
next second I was pouring machine-gun
bullets into the shadowy green
monsters, and they were floating, dead,
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>There was not one single, solitary
thing that could be done to save him.
Two minutes more, and his frail life-raft
would be sunk. There was no time
to fly back and get something to which he
could cling and drop it to him. He
couldn’t swim.</p>

<p>I fairly froze in my seat, as a great
mass of water rose from the sea. As it
cleared, I saw the tail of Penoch’s DeHaviland,
high in the air, less than ten
feet from Kennedy. The next second
Penoch was clambering up on the wreckage
of his own ship. A few seconds later
he was stripped to his underwear, and
swimming toward the crippled Kennedy.</p>

<p>As the little devil was towing his
enemy I came to myself. I circled watchfully
above the water, and machine-gunned
an approaching shark. As I
did that my stunned brain got working.
I don’t think I’m either better or worse
than the average. I’m franker, that’s all.
If I had been sitting in my ship, while
my deadly enemy was dying a sure death,
I would have been conscious of a sense
of relief.</p>

<p>Penoch O’Reilly had landed to give
him two hours more of life; it seemed a
certainty that at the end of two hours,
Penoch, too, would go down to the
sharks, with the man who had almost
ruined his life.</p>

<p>Then and there that squat, little figure,
ho-ho-ho-ing at life, grew into a giant,
towering above ordinary mortals, as far
as I was concerned.</p>

<p>“There must be some way,” I kept
telling myself over and over as I circled
them. Maybe I hypnotized myself into
an idea. I gave a war-whoop of relief.
Anything was better than one hundred
per cent. hopelessness.</p>

<p>Kennedy was hurt. That was apparent.
Penoch had to drag him up on
the fuselage, and then the reserve man
lay there as if he were completely out.</p>

<p>I made wild motions to Penoch; he
nodded. He was standing up, a small
white figure, his feet far apart to brace
himself against what fate had in store.
As I sped for land, I almost thought I
could hear him laughing that deep-toned,
Rabelaisian laugh, flinging his challenge
to the gods, a small white speck in the
dusk.</p>

<p>A moment after I had landed, I’d
told my story. Tex MacDowell and
Sleepy Spears were in their ships in two
seconds less than nothing, and we were
off. When we arrived, Penoch had the
upper left wing detached, and Kennedy
was on it.</p>

<p>From there O’Reilly started his heartbreaking
journey, a full mile, pushing that
wing slowly through the water, his legs
kicking tirelessly. Kennedy, partially
recovered, was using the vertical fin as a
paddle to help. Three airplanes cruised
round and round over the ugly water, and
not a shark got within our lines. Every
second was a strain, for the sharks could
come up from below and get Penoch, but
they did not. With so much dead meat
in the sea, I guess our outfit was entirely
too suspicious for them to bother with.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes after dark when
Penoch and Kennedy staggered up on
the beach. Kennedy collapsed. When
I got out of my plane, I was swaying like
a rubber lamp-post, and before Penoch
had been taken care of and got back, I
had eaten and fallen on a cot, fully dressed,
but dead to the world.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>Strange as it may seem, I didn’t
see either of them next day. Our
flyings came at different hours, and when
one was on the ground the others were
in the air. And at three in the afternoon,
when I landed, I found that Penoch
and Kennedy and Pete Miller had started
back for McMullen. Kennard, Sleepy
and Tex and I started home at five
o’clock. There were Donovan ships
available, and there’d been another bandit
raid in our territory. The patrol was
needed on the river.</p>

<p>I saw Penoch in the mess-hall, at dinner,
and sat next to him. We were all
ready to drop, and hadn’t even washed.
Kennard went to sleep over his soup.
Sleepy Spears gave up after the meat
course, and stumbled out to bed.</p>

<p>“Where’s Kennedy?” I asked Penoch.</p>

<p>“In at Shirley’s&mdash;for dinner,” he said
tersely and, as our eyes met, I guess our
thoughts were the same.</p>

<p>“Then what you did for him had no
effect, eh?” I finally asked him. “How’d
he act?”</p>

<p>“Avoids me.”</p>

<p>“I see. Come clean, Penoch. It
must have been a temptation to leave
him down there, even if you figured you’d
have a good chance of saving him.”</p>

<p>Penoch buttered some bread thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t; and I’d never thought
of that wing gag. Just had an idea that
there ought to be some way out&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So you tossed a few sharks right out
of your mind, eh?” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell, I didn’t think of anything,
except how nice it would be if he was
dead. Well, old-timer, he’s sure slapped
me in the face tonight by going back
there. Shows what he is. Hell, I’ve
been doing things for him all my life,
and he’s willing to blackmail me. Guess
I was a damn’ fool back over the Gulf, eh?
Well, there’ll be excitement about in a
few days, I guess. Better get some sleep
tonight. Ho-ho-ho!”</p>

<p>I knew then that he had fully made up
his mind, that he’d considered everything,
and was ready to go. And when that
crisis was passed with Penoch O’Reilly,
he feared not man, devil or circumstances.
Right at that moment he figured that the
Army was a thing of the past and that
the world was waiting to be bucked by a
man in disgrace. The tougher it was, the
louder he’d laugh.</p>

<p>The next day we both saw Kennedy
at breakfast. He greeted us with a
straight stare, said, “Hello,” in his customary
breezy manner, ate with relish,
and was absolutely himself. His eyes
were as cold a green as ever, except for
that surface shine that came when he
laughed. He told a good story about
Noah and the Johnstown flood, indulged
in his reminiscences of the Columbus raid
and likewise the Galveston flood, in all
of which he had participated with considerable
gusto.</p>

<p>I just sat there and watched him.
That clear-cut, hard face and those
fishy eyes made as impenetrable a mask
as I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>“The hell it’s a mask!” I finally told
myself. “He just hasn’t any feelings
that can’t be expressed in a grin or a
laugh or a snarl. He couldn’t hate anybody
real hard any more than he could
like anybody very much. Except himself.”</p>

<p>At lunch he came breezing in with:</p>

<p>“Well, well, the good old feedbag’ll
be fastened round my snoot <i>pronto</i>. The
meal ain’t been cooked that I can’t clean
up by myself.”</p>

<p>He shook out his napkin, grasped his
fork firmly and started in at the salad.
His eating was not a pronouncedly delicate
proceeding. It was audible for
miles around when he wasn’t trying to
act unnaturally elegant; and I believe
that in a straight contest Kennedy’s eating
anything could drown out my snoring.</p>

<p>“By the way, Peewee, my lad, how
about a bit of poker at Shirley’s Old
Man’s house tonight? I was given instructions
to ask you and Slim to come
out. Sheriff Trowbridge’ll be there, too.
Come, and bring your checkbook, because
it’s my night to howl!”</p>

<p>Penoch just looked at him. Kennedy
stared back with a mirthless smile.</p>

<p>“Risk a few nickels!” he gibed. “I
ain’t seen your game for years. How
about it? Shirley’ll be glad to see you
both, she said. She ain’t had much
time&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go.”</p>

<p>Simple, those words. But I knew as
surely as I knew that I was at the table
that Penoch’s deliberate interruption
was a threat. He stared straight at
Kennedy, and the implication in his
statement was plain for me to see. That
poker game that night was to include
some unscheduled fireworks. Shirley
and her father were to hear some hitherto
unknown episodes in the lives of Ralph
Kennedy and Percival Enoch O’Reilly.</p>

<p>“Fine! A good time’ll be had by all,”
Kennedy came back. “You act as though
you’d been invited to risk your life, or
attend your own funeral. Heh-heh-heh!
Didja hear him say that, boys? Peewee
don’t think any more of a nickel lost at
cards than he does his left eye.”</p>

<p>There he sat, gibing at the man who
had saved his life. It was apparent to
any one that there was a deadly undercurrent
in the conversation between the
two. I saw Kennard and Tex and the
others looking at them speculatively.</p>

<p>Directly after the meal I put it up to
Penoch.</p>

<p>“You’re going to lay your information
on the line tonight, eh?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Right. And my resignation’ll be
written. He doesn’t intend to back away
from Shirley. I can see that. Maybe
what I say won’t change a thing; but
she’ll go into it with her eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Damn’ funny, at that,” I said in considerable
bewilderment. “I don’t see
why a girl&mdash;any girl&mdash;could mean so
much to Kennedy that he’s willing to
run the risk of exposure as a criminal.
I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t think I’ll go through with
it,” rasped Penoch. “Well, I’m going
to take a nap.”</p>

<p>He strode away, his short legs twinkling
through the dust, toward his tent. He
didn’t sleep, though, because I peeked in
a few times. He wrote reams of letters,
setting his house in order, as it were,
before he moved out. And he didn’t
seem so downcast. In fact, the devil-may-careness
of his face had increased, and
there was hard recklessness there. He
had taken his hundredth knockout blow
from fate; and he was still standing erect,
unbeaten.</p>

<p>It was a long and tough afternoon for
me. Kennedy flew a patrol, and then
took a long time dressing for dinner. At
the meal he was in excellent form, holding
the floor continuously with ribald
tales, which were good. And Penoch
O’Reilly, his eyes bright, seemed strung
to a high nervous pitch. His roaring “Hoho-ho!”
rolled forth continuously, and he
and his enemy fought a silent battle of
eyes beneath the laughter. I was depressed
and silent, but possessed with
such infinite hatred and repulsion when
I thought of Kennedy that I could have
stuck the bread-knife in his throat and
enjoyed it.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>I felt as if I were riding deliberately
into disaster, when we went to the
Curran house. Sheriff Trowbridge, Gargantuan
old-timer, who had been friend
and aid to the flight since its inception,
was already there. He was six feet two,
with a shock of iron-gray hair, a great
mustache, and a genial old face tanned to
mahogany. He and Mr. Curran had been
friends for years and, as we came up on
the porch, Mr. Curran yelled in stentorian
tones&mdash;</p>

<p>“Three new customers, sugar!”</p>

<p>He was tall and thin and bald, with
piercing eyes and an aquiline nose, all of
which gave him the appearance of a
soft-hearted old eagle.</p>

<p>In a moment Shirley came out, bearing
three long, cold drinks. Her eyes were
on Kennedy. When I saw the smile on
her lips and the look in those eyes, I sort
of caught my breath. I don’t know
much about love, but almost anybody
can recognize it when it stares them right
in the face.</p>

<p>She was all in white, her golden hair
slicked back, throwing her features into
bold relief. Slim and lithe and tall, she
looked every inch a thoroughbred. Kennedy,
as he bent over her, was a good-looking
officer, too. You couldn’t see
those mean eyes, in profile.</p>

<p>“And women are supposed to have intuition!”
I groaned.</p>

<p>At that, there was a sort of new note in
Kennedy’s smile&mdash;a trace of real feeling&mdash;when
he looked at her; and his eyes were a
little less hard, maybe.</p>

<p>But the adulation was principally on
her part. From the time the game
started he seemed to avoid even looking
at her. He played quietly, as did everybody.
Every man around that table
was a lover of poker and a hater of conversation
when the pasteboards were
being wooed. Even Shirley had had it
bred in the bone, I guess, and never
said a word. She tended to the ash
receivers, brought us drinks, and finally
went out on the porch to throw a ten-minute
sop to a boy friend who had
called on her.</p>

<p>The game was twenty-dollar take out,
table stakes, and either draw or stud,
to be played at the option of the dealers.
Penoch watched Kennedy like a hawk,
and so did I, on general principles. Not
that I really thought he’d try his tricks
there.</p>

<p>The most amazing thing to me was
his utter nonchalance. He knew what
Penoch was going to do before the evening
was over; and he grinned into the
little flyer’s face and dared him with his
eyes.</p>

<p>It was close to ten o’clock, and I was
about fifty dollars ahead, Penoch even,
and Kennedy sixty dollars winner. We’d
been taking the two old-timers over the
jumps, to our great glee and their humorous
disgust.</p>

<p>It was Kennedy’s deal. He shuffled
them, and I saw him casually put an ace
on the bottom before he started. When
he finished, he gave the cards a rapid
double cut&mdash;bottom half of the deck
placed on top, but a little forward of the
other half of the deck. Then he simply
cut again, and that little shelf between
the two halves of the deck enabled him to
replace the cards exactly. That is, after
two cuts, the cards lay exactly as they
had before he’d cut them, the first time.</p>

<p>It was my cut, and he did not offer it,
but started dealing.</p>

<p>My eyes were busy from that moment
on. My heart was pounding as I visualized
the possibilities. Maybe I could
get Penoch out of the mess.</p>

<p>Card after card fell. Kennedy was
high, with a king showing, and held the
bet until the fourth card had dropped,
when Sheriff Trowbridge drew an ace.
I stayed, and Kennedy raised ten dollars.
That dropped Penoch and Mr. Curran.
The sheriff came back with a thirty-dollar
re-raise, and I, with a pair of fours,
dropped and devoted myself to watching.
Had that cut been an accident? If it
hadn’t, how had Kennedy stacked them
for himself? Or did his crookedness
merely include the placing of one lone
ace to use if necessary?</p>

<p>He came back with a fifty-dollar raise&mdash;his
stack. The sheriff, who had bought
four times already and had plenty of chips
in front of him, saw the raise.</p>

<p>Every eye was concentrated on Kennedy.
I was peering so hard it hurt,
and somehow my mouth felt dry. Shirley
came in, her eyes widening at the size
of the pot. She stood back of Kennedy,
without saying a word. I knew that she
comprehended the hands perfectly&mdash;the
sheriff with ace, queen, ten showing;
Kennedy with king, queen, deuce.</p>

<p>Slowly Kennedy flipped the sheriff’s
card. A seven. Kennedy studied his
own hand a moment, and his eyes flickered
around the table, a curious light
in them. Suddenly he dealt. An ace!
And from the bottom of the deck, so
clumsily done that any one in the world
could have caught it.</p>

<p>“Pair of aces!” he crowed, showing his
hole card.</p>

<p>The silence was like a physical substance,
throbbing and heavy and packed
with evil. My eyes rested on Shirley’s
face. Her eyes were wide and horror-stricken,
and she looked as if she were
about to scream.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was shattered by
the blow of Curran’s fist on the table.
As if it had set a spring into action, every
man around that table, except Kennedy,
was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Out of this house, you thieving, yellow,
sneaking crook!” thundered the old
man furiously. “There ain’t a man here
didn’t see you take that ace from the bottom!
Git out, I tell you, or I’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>He choked with his own wrath, as he
crouched as if to leap across the table.</p>

<p>Kennedy got up leisurely, his eyes
hard enough to make one’s flesh crawl.
They held an expression that I can not
describe, but this I was sure of, crazy as
it seemed&mdash;there was no rage in them.
Perhaps he couldn’t feel deeply enough to
wax furious. It was as if he were dead.</p>

<p>“I guess you caught me,” he said
evenly.</p>

<p>He pulled down his blouse and ran his
hand through his hair. Penoch was like
a statue. Not one sound broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Then there came a strangled sob from
Shirley. She rushed from the room, and
from somewhere in the hall, before she
got out of earshot, we heard her weeping.</p>

<p>I licked my lips with my tongue. I
saw Curran’s face twitch, and such demonaic
fury leap into his eyes that I was
afraid of murder. I believe he’d have
sprung at Kennedy in another second.</p>

<p>“Sorry. Good night,” Kennedy said
slowly, almost as if he were playing a part.</p>

<p>He walked out without haste, and without
a word or a look to any one of us.</p>

<p>“God! I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>Penoch’s deep bass seemed to reverberate
from the walls. As the sheriff
broke into deep curses, Penoch interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“Please, Sheriff, let me get this off my
chest. Maybe you’ll be through with me,
now, too.”</p>

<p>They sank into their chairs, Mr. Curran
wiping his brow with a shaking hand.
As Penoch made a clean breast of his
relationship with Kennedy, I half listened,
but I didn’t pay close attention at
that. A thousand crazy ideas were running
through my head, and suddenly it
seemed as if I couldn’t wait to get
Penoch alone. I had a queer hunch.</p>

<p>Those old-timers understood the little
flyer’s position, and the sheriff summed
up the general sentiment, when he put his
hand on Penoch’s shoulder and told him:</p>

<p>“Mike, here, and me, ain’t blamin’
you a bit, son. And you was ready to
prevent any trouble. You couldn’t be
blamed, any way you take it, for givin’
him the benefit of the doubt for a while.
Gosh! What a snake in the grass he is!
And I aim to git him in jail. We’ll
plaster him for life&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And me with him,” barked O’Reilly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Say, young feller, he
can go up for a long time right in this
country for what he done! More’n he
deserves for this trick; but we’ll sort o’
consider his other crimes, see?”</p>

<p>“Listen Sheriff,” I found myself saying.
“Some way or another I’ve got a
funny idea. Let me talk it over with
Penoch and call you back, eh?”</p>

<p>The leonine old man peered at me
through puckered eyes.</p>

<p>“Shore,” he commented. “But what’s
the secret?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when I’m sure of it myself,”
I told him. “Good night, Mr. Curran.
I sure hope Shirley won’t take it
too hard.”</p>

<p>“She will, for awhile. But when I
think o’ what might ’a’ happened if he
hadn’t give himself away&mdash;say, I ought
to be thankful for this night!”</p>

<p>We had no sooner got out the door
and into the car than I said:</p>

<p>“Don’t start her for a minute. Penoch,
my boy, just how good it was, or ought to
be Kennedy with his fingers and a deck
of cards?”</p>

<p>“Used to be a wonder!”</p>

<p>“And he deliberately, before five people,
does the clumsiest piece of cheating
a man ever did in the world! If he’d
wanted to be caught, he couldn’t have
done it more openly.”</p>

<p>“By God!”</p>

<p>It was almost a prayer from Penoch.
Then he faced me, tense and strained,
and his attempted whisper couldn’t have
been heard more than a hundred feet.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have done it deliberately!
I know what you think&mdash;that because of
what I did for him at Laguna he decided
to give up Shirley and took that way.
But all he had to do was walk out on her,
without putting himself in disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Let’s talk to him,” I suggested, and
we started immediately to make a new
speed record between McMullen and the
flying field.</p>

<p>It did seem ridiculous. For what possible
reason, short of sheer insanity, would
a man brand himself a card-cheat? A
man who’d do that would cut off his head
to cure an earache. I couldn’t make head
nor tail of it, but I was exuding curiosity
in corpulent chunks. I aimed to get at
the bottom of things, and quickly.</p>

<hr class='tb'>


<p class='ni'>We found him in his tent, alone,
holding communion with a large
bottle of <i>tequila</i>.</p>

<p>He stared at us, as we came in, and I’ll
swear his eyes brought me up short.
There was suffering in them, and a sort of
bewilderment. It changed the whole
aspect of the man. It was his eyes that
repelled one, ordinarily. Now that there
was something human in them, the change
was magical.</p>

<p>Penoch O’Reilly planted himself, as
per usual, his mustache turned upward
belligerently, and his eyes snapping.</p>

<p>“Regardless of anything else, Ralph,
how the ’ell did you happen to cheat so
clumsily? The cheating I can understand;
the way it was done I can’t.”</p>

<p>Kennedy took a big drink, gave us one
and, as he poured them, said sardonically:</p>

<p>“You give me credit for knowing better,
then? You ought to.”</p>

<p>“If you did it deliberately, why?” I
broke in. “If you wanted to do what
Penoch asked, and lay off the girl&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We both happened to be in love,”
he said calmly, as if laughing up his sleeve.
His eyes, however, were averted.</p>

<p>“Huh?” snorted Penoch scathingly.
“You in love?”</p>

<p>“For the first and only time in my life,”
Kennedy admitted casually, his back
toward us. “In fact, I’m so nuts about
her that I couldn’t let her in for what
she’d be in for with me. Don’t flatter
yourself, Peewee. It wasn’t for you I
did it. It was for her.”</p>

<p>“But why that way?” I barked.</p>

<p>“If I just broke off,” he said, eying a
new glass of <i>tequila</i> with narrowed eyes,
“she’d have taken a long while to get
over it. Might as well cut everything off
clean, show her what I am all at once, and
blackjack her into hating me. Make it
easier all around.”</p>

<p>For a moment his eyes met mine, and
the mask was off. I don’t get sentimental
as a rule, but I was looking at a man
whose whole life had come up to torture
him, and who was going through an accumulation
of suffering.</p>

<p>“By the way, Peewee, I’m resigning,
of course, and leaving tomorrow on the
five o’clock. Probably’ll have to borrow
some dough. I’d like to take a last ride,
so keep things quiet until I get it, eh?”</p>

<p>Penoch nodded wordlessly. Cocky as
he was ordinarily, and sure of himself,
he was nonplussed now. Kennedy had
turned into a strange species of animal to
him, and he couldn’t believe it.</p>

<p>“And now,” grinned Kennedy, keeping
up his bluff to the last, “will you two get
the hell out of here and let a gentleman
and a scholar get drunk in peace and
quiet?”</p>

<p>“Don’t want any company?” Penoch
asked him, and there was real pleading
in his tone.</p>

<p>For the first time in our acquaintance
I saw actual softness in Kennedy’s eyes,
as he looked at the man he had liked and
admired as much as it had been possible
for him to feel those emotions for anybody.</p>


<p>“Nope. Let’s shuck the past, eh what?
What the hell? And I’ve got to do a little
high-powered thinking. ’Night.”</p>

<p>We walked thoughtfully out into the
starlight. Then I made a profound remark.</p>


<p>“I’ve heard of the miracles that love is
supposed to work, but this is the first
one I’ve seen. I think the combination of
you risking your life for him, and a real
unselfish feeling for a girl, has sort of
opened up a new world to Kennedy.
He’s got guts, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Never lacked those,” boomed Penoch.
“At that, you may be right. I guess he’s
always figured every hand was against
him&mdash;and now that he’s found out
there’s a little white in the world he
doesn’t know what to make of it. He
proved himself, all right, tonight, but
if he’d told me that this afternoon I’d
have laughed as hard as I would over a
romantic yarn about the honeymoon of a
salmon.”</p>

<p>“’Night. I don’t feel much like talking.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I didn’t either. I
wandered around the field, smoking a
few reflective cigarets, and finally called
up the sheriff. I told him the whole
story, and he was satisfied that everything
pointed to the fact that if he didn’t
make a move everything was all right.
I figured it was better, and so did he,
that Shirley should never know the inside.
Consequently, the Currans were
not called up, and have not had the real
dope to this day.</p>

<p>I finally went to sleep, but in the morning
I was, of course, still thinking about
one Ralph Kennedy. And for some funny
reason I wasn’t sure of him&mdash;his sincerity,
I mean. I was wondering whether
there wasn’t some trick connected with
his gesture of the night before. However,
I thought it best, at breakfast&mdash;to which
meal he did not lend his presence&mdash;to tell
the boys the entire yarn, simply to offset
the gossip that would run wild around
McMullen. Mr. Curran, of course,
would eventually spill the beans, and I
wanted the gang to speak up, knowing the
facts, and say whatever they deemed best.
Furthermore, I had a funny idea that
when Kennedy left, I didn’t want him to
go in disgrace.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, I came to think
more and more of this last flight stuff.
All flyers are more or less superstitious
about that. As a matter of fact, there
have been a few, from Hobey Baker
down, who’ve met their Waterloo on the
last hop before they kissed the Air Service
good-by. I had a sort of premonition
that it shouldn’t be taken.</p>

<p>Consequently, when Kennedy ate bacon
and eggs at lunch, with his eyes red,
a hang-over sticking out all over him, I
said:</p>

<p>“Listen, big boy, you’ve said you were
leaving tonight and likewise that you
were going to take a last jazz flight. You
were drunk as a hoot owl last night, and
I don’t think you’ll be in such good shape
to fly this afternoon. Why not douse the
idea of a hop?”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ve got a good idea there,”
he said with a grin that didn’t change the
suffering eyes. “In fact, it’s probably the
good old logic. Say, Peewee, how about
you taking me for a ride, so nothing’ll
happen?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>I just happened to switch my gaze from
one to the other, and I saw something.
There were many experiences that they
had gone through together in the past,
which, naturally, had generated a certain
feeling between them. But now each
of them had discerned something in the
other that transcended anything that
they had previously known.</p>

<p>In short, I saw a man’s affection for
another man shining from each pair of
eyes.</p>

<p>The rest of the gang, knowing the entire
situation, chimed in with a lot of Air
Service kidding, about that last ride, as
for instance, Sleepy Spears’ remark:</p>

<p>“Any hop is foolish, and a last one is
suicide. You’ve made it sure death by
letting Penoch fly you.”</p>

<p>“In fact,” Tex MacDowell chimed in,
in his soft southern drawl, “I’ve had a
shovel all ready to pick Penoch up with,
for a long time. I’d pick a hang-over in
preference to Penoch any time.”</p>

<p>I guess nobody outside of the men who
fly understand what air kidding is.
Probably I don’t myself. But in my
dumb way I think that it’s like a kid’s
whistling when he passes a graveyard, or,
perhaps, laughing at the worst that could
happen, so that, when it does happen, it
won’t mean anything.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>When lunch was over, and we were
all drifting out of the mess-hall, I
suddenly realized that I would like to
share, a little bit, those last hours. I’d
been so close to the thing that I wanted to
hang around the outskirts of it, until
Kennedy left. In other words, I was
sentimental, and I thought quite a lot of
Penoch, at that. So I said casually&mdash;“I
think I’ll take a little private hop for
myself when you do&mdash;a sort of chaser for
the poker game, eh?”</p>

<p>Kennedy, I think, bewildered as he was
at the world that had been opened to
him so recently, appreciated the impulse
behind my suggestion.</p>

<p>“Sort of be my guard of honor, eh?”
he said. But those cold eyes were soft.
“In fact, we’ll be glad to have company,
won’t we Peewee?”</p>

<p>And so it happened that a half-hour
later the three of us were on the line. Our
two ships were being warmed up, and the
mechanics, satisfied, had brought them
down to idling.</p>

<p>“I’ll sit in the back seat, big boy,”
Penoch told Kennedy, “but don’t think
that I won’t take the stick away from
you any time!”</p>

<p>You know, of course, that De Havilands
are dual-control ships, but all the
instruments are in the front cockpit, and
that, in a manner of speaking, is the
driver’s seat.</p>

<p>I got into my own plane and, as I
taxied out for the take-off, I couldn’t
exactly analyze my reason for being
there. I guess it was a sort of vague tribute
to Kennedy, and yet I had a funny
feeling that something might happen&mdash;so
much so that as I turned the motor full on
and pushed the stick forward I was so
absent-minded that I nearly broke the
propeller, because I had the nose of the
plane down so far.</p>

<p>Kennedy and Penoch had taken off
first, and I just followed them as they
circled the field for altitude. When we
got to the tremendous height of fifteen
hundred feet, Kennedy, who was doing
the piloting, started due west for Laredo.</p>

<p>I’ll swear that we were not a thousand
yards from the airdrome when it happened.
I was flying possibly a hundred
yards back of them, and almost the same
distance to the right. All of a sudden I
saw their ship go into a dive.</p>

<p>That meant something. When Kennedy
started turning back toward the
field I knew that the motor had cut out.
Then, as I noticed the propeller, I knew
that the motor had not only cut out, but
had cut dead. The stick was revolving
slower and slower. There was no motor
power behind it.</p>

<p>The next second their ship was blanketed
in fire. The motor was a mass of
blue flame. Kennedy had not cocked the
ship up into a side-slip soon enough.
That blows the flames upward, away
from the pilot. The left wing was afire
before he started slipping, and that second
of backward draught, because they were
in a dive when the fire started, had caused
the fuselage to catch fire in a dozen places.</p>

<p>My body and brain were numb. Even
so, I subconsciously knew what had happened.
The gas line had broken, and the
gas, sprayed over the hot motor, had
ignited.</p>

<p>They had gone into the slip&mdash;too late&mdash;before
I started toward them. I was
diving my ship, motor full on. There was
nothing I could do&mdash;Penoch and Kennedy
burned to death before my eyes&mdash;I was
just getting nearer for no reason.</p>

<p>I suppose that it registered on me at the
time, because I remember it so vividly
now. Penoch told me what was said.
Anyway, I saw Kennedy, bearing the
brunt of the fire in the front cockpit, turn
and gesture. He was talking. I could
see through the smoke and fire his lips
moving. Penoch told me that what he
said was:</p>

<p>“Get out on the wing! I’m not leaving
the ship&mdash;&nbsp;Let me jump! If Slim sees
you, he’ll get close. God! I can’t last
long! It’ll just be two instead of one&mdash;”</p>

<p>What I saw was Penoch getting out of
the back cockpit, hanging by his hands
from the cowling. He hauled himself
along the side of the ship, his feet dangling
over space. His head was turned
backward, to protect his eyes, and his
clothing was charring, because he was out
where the air-stream could reach him, and
no flame could get a real start. But
Kennedy, in the cockpit&mdash;</p>

<p>I was going through the most horrible
nightmare that can be conceived. And
yet, I instinctively sensed the possibility
of saving Penoch, as he reached the right
wing and started crawling along it.</p>

<p>Then Ralph brought the burning ship
level; that blew the fire right back on him.
I was close, and for that horrible minute I
guess I ceased to think of my own safety.
I knew that there was one desperate
chance to save one of the two, and Penoch,
of course, was the one, because Kennedy
had willed it so.</p>

<p>Penoch was out of the fire now, at the
edge of the right wing. He was hanging
from the edge of it by his hands as I flew
my ship up into position, my left wing
underneath the other’s right one. And
Kennedy&mdash;I don’t know by what transcendent
power he was able to do it, as he
burned to death&mdash;kept his ship level.
Penoch dropped&mdash;his only chance for
life&mdash;and he landed on my left wing. He
grabbed the cabane strut, the little metal
horn at the edge of the wing to which the
control wires for the ailerons are attached,
and passed out.</p>

<p>An instant later, Kennedy, a human
bonfire, leaped from his burning ship.
He fell out&mdash;blessed surcease from pain.
And the ship, like a flaming coffin, seemed
to follow his body down.</p>

<p>Penoch eventually got back into the
rear cockpit, of course, and we’re both
here to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Sometime I hope that a burning ship
will cease to trace a crimson path across
my dreams. Probably it won’t.</p>

<p>Anyway, if Ralph is a spook in some
spiritual village, teaching the Twelve
Apostles how to play poker, I hope he
has time to tip his halo in acknowledgment
of the salute of Slim Evans to a
crook and a hero, a scoundrel and a man.</p>
